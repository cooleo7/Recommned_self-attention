These models are executed in GPU environment. 
I used Google colab to use GPU machine. (Python 3.10.12)

Step1) Save ratings.csv which is generated by preprocess to 'data', 'data_movie', and 'Others' folder. Save data.npz which is generated by CSE to 'data' folder. ratins.csv and data.npz are different depending on the condition of experiment. If you want to test CASE5, then you should save the ratings5.csv to 'data', 'data_movie', and 'Others' folder, after that you should change the file name from ratings5.csv to ratings.csv. Also, you should change the file name from data5.npz to data.npz in 'data' folder.

The current file is for CASE5.
If you want to test other CASE, then refer the examples below.

But, I already stored these files in a 'input' folder. data1~6.npz files are stored in CSE/CASE1~6/data folder.
Eg.) ratings4.csv -> CASE1,2,3
     ratings5.csv -> CASE5
     ratings8.csv -> CASE6
     ratings9.csv -> CASE4
     data1.npz -> CASE1
     data2.npz -> CASE2
     data3.npz -> CASE3
     data4.npz -> CASE4
     data5.npz -> CASE5
     data6.npz -> CASE6



Step2) Modify the yaml files in 'templates' folder to control hyper-parameters.
       You can change the hyper-parameter you want to change depending on CASEs.
       The current file is for CASE5.


Step3) Execute 'New benchmark.ipynb'
       According to your environment, you could change some files like below.

       Eg.1) /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/dotmap/__init__.py
	     from collections.abc import MutableMapping
       Eg.2) /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/wandb/wandb_config.py
	     from collections.abc import Sequence

       You can execute each command for each case of a model. Refer to the markdown comment in each 
       case.
